How to Deploy on GitHub Pages (Free Hosting)
GitHub Pages hosts your dashboard for free at a permanent public URL. No server, no hosting fees, no technical knowledge required beyond following these steps.

⏱  Time Required
Initial setup: approximately 10 minutes
Your site will be live within 2–3 minutes of completing Step 4

Step-by-Step Setup

1	Create a Free GitHub Account
→  Go to github.com in your browser
→  Click Sign up (top right corner)
→  Enter your email address and create a password
→  Choose the Free plan when prompted
→  Verify your email address to activate the account

2	Create a New Repository
→  Click the + icon (top right) → select New repository
→  Repository name: pisc-tech  (no spaces, lowercase)
→  Visibility: select Public  (required for free GitHub Pages)
→  Leave all other settings as default — do NOT tick any checkboxes
→  Click the green Create repository button

3	Upload Your Dashboard File
→  In your new empty repository, click uploading an existing file
→  Drag and drop your downloaded  pisc-ai-marketing-strategy.html  file
→  IMPORTANT: In the filename box, rename it to  index.html  exactly
→  Scroll down to Commit changes → click the green Commit changes button
→  Wait for the file to finish uploading (progress bar at top)

4	Enable GitHub Pages
→  Click Settings in the top menu of your repository
→  Scroll down the left sidebar and click Pages
→  Under Build and deployment → Source → select Deploy from a branch
→  Branch dropdown: select main
→  Folder dropdown: select / (root)
→  Click Save

🌐  Your Live URL
Wait 2–3 minutes, then refresh the GitHub Pages settings screen.
Your permanent URL will appear in a green banner:
https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/pisc-tech/
Replace YOUR-USERNAME with your actual GitHub username.
Share this URL with clients, staff, and on your business card.


Files in This Repository

File	Purpose	Action Required
index.html	Main interactive dashboard — all 7 tabs	Rename from pisc-ai-marketing-strategy.html before upload
README.md	This setup guide	Optional — upload for team reference


How to Update the Dashboard
Any time content changes — new products, updated pricing, revised strategy — update your live site in under 2 minutes:

1.	Go to your GitHub repository: github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/pisc-tech
2.	Click index.html in the file list
3.	Click the pencil icon (Edit this file) — top right of the file view
4.	Select all content (Ctrl+A / Cmd+A) and paste your updated HTML
5.	Scroll down → click Commit changes → Commit changes again
6.	Your site is live with the update within 30 seconds

💡  Pro Tip — Batch Updates
Make all your changes locally first (open index.html in Notepad or any text editor),
then do a single GitHub commit. This keeps your version history clean
and means the site only rebuilds once instead of multiple times.


What Works Out of the Box

	Feature	Detail
✅	All 7 tabs interactive	Click any tab — instant navigation, no page reload
✅	PISC Tech logo embedded	Logo baked into the file — no external image files needed
✅	Works offline	No internet connection required after download
✅	Mobile responsive	Works on phone, tablet, laptop, desktop
✅	Zero cost hosting	GitHub Pages is permanently free for public repositories
✅	No login for visitors	Anyone with the URL can view it — no GitHub account needed
✅	No dependencies	Pure HTML/CSS/JS — no frameworks, no CDN, no npm


Troubleshooting

Site not appearing after Step 4
•	Wait the full 2–3 minutes — GitHub Pages does not update instantly
•	Hard-refresh your browser: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
•	Check that your repository is set to Public (not Private) in Settings → General
•	Confirm the file is named exactly index.html (lowercase, no spaces)

Tabs not working (show is not defined error)
•	This means the HTML file was corrupted in transit — re-download from Claude
•	Do not open and re-save the file in Word or Google Docs — use a plain text editor only
•	Recommended editors: Notepad (Windows), TextEdit plain text mode (Mac), VS Code

Logo not displaying
•	The logo is embedded as base64 inside the HTML file — no separate image file is needed
•	If logo is missing, the file may have been truncated during download — re-download

🚫  Do Not Do This
Do NOT open index.html in Microsoft Word or Google Docs — these apps corrupt HTML files.
Do NOT rename the file to anything other than index.html — GitHub Pages requires this exact name.
Do NOT set the repository to Private — GitHub Pages requires a Public repository on the free plan.
Do NOT use Internet Explorer — use Chrome, Edge, Firefox, or Safari.
